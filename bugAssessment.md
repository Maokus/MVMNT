You asked for (a) assessment of `timelineStore` tests still assuming seconds after migration to ticks, (b) a full analysis of transport/timing handling (pause/play jump, tempo change not taking effect), with at least 5 reasons these problems might occur, (c) validation of assumptions against code, and (d) proposed solutions.

Below I break this down.

---

## 1. Test File Assessment (Seconds vs Ticks)

The file timelineStore.behavior.test.ts still writes and asserts directly on `currentTimeSec`, `loopStartSec`, `loopEndSec`, `timelineView.startSec/endSec`, etc. Since the canonical domain is now ticks (`currentTick`), these tests are exercising the Phase‑4 legacy shim rather than the authoritative fields. That means:

-   They could pass while masking tick-domain regressions (e.g., if seconds derivation drifts or is out-of-sync, the test might not detect the tick problem).
-   They re-seed state with `currentTimeSec: 12` but do not explicitly synchronize `currentTick`. The shim later attempts to infer tick from seconds if `currentTick` were missing; but here `currentTick` still exists, so you can get mismatch if you intended to move tick.

Other test suites (`playPause.noHalfBarJump`, `pause.noJump`, `playheadScrub.paused`, etc.) already use `currentTick`—these are aligned with the new canonical domain.

Conclusion: timelineStore.behavior.test.ts (and any tests building synthetic `TimelineState` objects with only seconds fields like in some selector phase tests) should be modernized to seed and assert using ticks; seconds assertions should become derived expectations only if still needed.

## 2. Observed Runtime Issues and Root Cause Candidates

You observed:

1. On pause then play, the playhead "jumps" forward by an amount proportional to the pause duration (implying the underlying clock keeps accruing).
2. Changing tempo in the UI, then pressing play, yields no audible/visual tempo change (tempo change not propagating to playback tick progression).
3. Potential mismatch between tick and seconds-based tests causing false confidence.
4. Looping / quantization interactions (historical half-bar jump) still suspicious.
5. General inconsistency when switching BPM while paused or after scrubbing.

### At least 5 Concrete Reasons (Code-Referenced):

Reason A: PlaybackClock continues updating during pause due to animation loop logic

-   **CORRECTION**: The `PlaybackClock` itself does NOT have a pause API, but the animation loop in `VisualizerContext.tsx` (lines ~180-220) correctly guards clock updates with `if (state.transport.isPlaying)`. However, the visualizer itself may continue running independently and could cause time drift.
-   The real issue is that the visualizer (legacy seconds-based) and the tick-based clock can get out of sync during pause/resume cycles, particularly when the visualizer continues its own internal timing.
-   Evidence: Animation loop checks `state.transport.isPlaying` before calling `clock.update()`, but visualizer synchronization logic may override this in some cases.

Reason B: Multiple TimingManager instances cause BPM synchronization issues

-   **CONFIRMED**: The store uses `_tmSingleton = new TimingManager()` (line ~215) for internal conversions, but `VisualizerContext` creates separate `TimingManager` instances (lines ~157, ~194, ~228) for the playback clock and format conversions.
-   When `setGlobalBpm` updates the store's internal timing manager, it doesn't propagate to the clock's timing manager or other UI instances.
-   Evidence: `setGlobalBpm` (lines ~438-460) only updates the store's `_tmSingleton` via BPM recalculation for cached notes, but doesn't export or sync the timing manager used by external `PlaybackClock` instances.

Reason C: **UPDATED**: Visualizer-Clock synchronization race conditions

-   The animation loop has complex bi-directional sync logic between the tick-based clock and the seconds-based visualizer. During paused states, manual scrubs can create race conditions where:
    -   User scrubs tick → converts to seconds → seeks visualizer
    -   Visualizer time drifts → converts back to ticks → overrides user's tick
-   Authority switching between 'tick', 'seconds', 'clock', and 'user' can create inconsistencies, especially in the subscription shim (lines ~720-800) which tries to keep tick/seconds in sync.
-   Evidence: Lines 220-260 in VisualizerContext show complex paused-state sync logic that tries to detect "who moved" but could misinterpret small timing discrepancies as user actions.

Reason D: Quantize-on-play logic may still snap unexpectedly relative to wall-clock integrated tick

-   In `play()` logic (lines ~470-505), snapping only happens if `!wasPlaying && quantize === 'bar'`. If the underlying (ignored) clock has already advanced ticks (because it was never paused), the first tick injection after resuming may appear larger; plus if user paused mid-bar and the real clock advanced into the next bar invisibly, snapping back can look like a reverse + forward sequence in UI updates.
-   Evidence: The guard doesn't freeze or align the `PlaybackClock`; it only manipulates store tick.

Reason E: Tests initializing only seconds fields create incomplete scenarios for tick-based playback

-   Example: timelineStore.behavior.test.ts sets `timeline.currentTimeSec = 12` but does not set `currentTick`; later conversions or inferred semantics may differ from a true runtime where tick is authoritative. This hides issues like incorrect tick-to-seconds conversion after tempo change.
-   Evidence: Test file content lines 1-40; no `currentTick` reset.

Reason F (extra): Tempo change does not recompute `playbackRange` or loop tick spans

-   When `setGlobalBpm` updates note seconds, it does not adjust existing `loopStartTick` / `loopEndTick` or `playbackRange` even though those might have been originally derived from seconds assumptions; user might expect loop region in "seconds length" to stretch/shrink with tempo change, but tick domain stays constant.
-   Evidence: `setGlobalBpm` only iterates cache notes; no update to transport loop tick positions or timeline view window.

Reason G (extra): Independent TimingManager instances fragment state

-   UI code instantiates a new `TimingManager` in `TimelinePanel` (lines ~240-260) just for formatting; diverges from the one driving playback or store conversions, leading to inconsistent formatting if BPM changes but panel instance not re-created / reconfigured at right time.
-   Evidence: `const tm = new TimingManager(); tm.setBPM(bpm || 120); tm.setTempoMap(tempoMap, 'seconds');` rather than referencing a shared manager.

## 3. Validation (Mapping Reasons to Code Evidence)

| Reason | Evidence Snippet / Location                                                                                      | Validation                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Animation loop guards clock updates with `isPlaying` check, but visualizer sync logic can override in some cases | **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - Clock itself is properly guarded |
| B      | `setGlobalBpm` (lines ~438+) updates store only; multiple `new TimingManager()` instances in VisualizerContext   | **CONFIRMED** - Multiple unsynced instances              |
| C      | Bi-directional sync logic (lines ~220-260 VisualizerContext) with complex authority switching                    | **CONFIRMED** - Race conditions possible                 |
| D      | `play()` quantize logic (lines ~500-520) lacks clock coordination                                                | **CONFIRMED** - No clock alignment after snap            |
| E      | Test sets only `currentTimeSec` (behavior test lines 1-20)                                                       | **CONFIRMED** - Tests are seconds-centric                |
| F      | `setGlobalBpm` lacks playbackRange/loop adjustments                                                              | **CONFIRMED** - No loop tick recalculation               |
| G      | Multiple `TimingManager` instantiations throughout VisualizerContext                                             | **CONFIRMED** - Creates fragmented state                 |

All reasons found directly in code; no speculative external dependencies required.

## 4. Proposed Solutions (Actionable)

### 4.1 Core Architectural Fixes - **REVISED**

1. **Single Source of Timing Truth** ✅ **CRITICAL**

    - Export the `_tmSingleton` from timelineStore or create a shared timing service
    - Replace all `new TimingManager()` instances in VisualizerContext with references to the shared instance
    - Ensure PlaybackClock uses the same shared TimingManager
    - **Impact**: This directly addresses Reason B (multiple timing managers) and would immediately fix BPM change propagation issues

2. **Simplify Visualizer-Clock Synchronization** ✅ **CRITICAL**

    - The current bi-directional sync logic in VisualizerContext is overly complex and error-prone
    - Establish clear authority hierarchy: Clock → Store → Visualizer (unidirectional flow)
    - Remove complex "who moved" detection logic that can misinterpret timing discrepancies
    - During playback: Clock drives store, store drives visualizer
    - During pause: User scrubs update store, store updates both clock and visualizer
    - **Impact**: This addresses Reason C (synchronization race conditions)

3. **Coordinate Clock with Transport State Changes** ✅ **IMPORTANT**

    - When `play()` includes quantization, call `clock.setTick(snappedTick)` to align clock state
    - Consider adding `clock.reset()` on pause to clear fractional accumulator
    - **Impact**: Addresses Reason D (quantize alignment issues)

4. **Tempo Change Propagation** ✅ **CRITICAL**

    - When `setGlobalBpm` or `setMasterTempoMap` runs, update the shared `TimingManager` immediately
    - Consider calling `clock.reset()` to clear any tempo-dependent fractional state
    - **Impact**: Ensures tempo changes take effect immediately (addresses core user complaint)

5. **Authority Semantics Simplification** ✅ **MEDIUM**

    - Reduce authority values to: 'clock' (during playback), 'user' (manual scrubs)
    - Remove 'seconds' authority to eliminate sync complexity
    - **Impact**: Reduces authority-related race conditions

6. **Optional Transport Controller** 🔄 **LOW PRIORITY**
    - The current VisualizerContext animation loop already serves this purpose
    - Could be refactored for cleaner separation, but not critical for fixing current bugs
    - **Impact**: Code organization improvement, not bug fix

### 4.2 Migration of Tests

-   Update timelineStore.behavior.test.ts:

    -   Initialize using `currentTick` instead of `currentTimeSec`.
    -   Replace assertions on `timelineView.startSec/endSec` with assertions on tick-window or (if needed) compute expected seconds via a helper referencing the global BPM.
    -   Keep a minimal derived seconds check by computing expected seconds from `currentTick / PPQ * secondsPerBeat`.

-   Add a new test ensuring pause truly freezes advancement:

    -   Simulate clock updates while `isPlaying=false` and assert tick unchanged.
    -   Then resume and assert correct incremental tick.

-   Add test that BPM change mid-play immediately affects delta (e.g., simulate two update intervals around a BPM change and confirm tick delta ratio changes).

### 4.3 Backward Compatibility

-   For legacy UI still reading seconds, keep the subscription derivation but remove any pathway that sets `currentTimeSec` directly.
-   Mark legacy methods (`setCurrentTimeSec`, `seek(seconds)`, etc.) with console.warning to encourage migration; internally convert seconds->ticks and call `setCurrentTick`.

### 4.4 Loop & Quantize Interaction

-   On `play()` if quantize == 'bar':
    -   Instead of snapping tick directly, compute bar-aligned tick boundaries via `TimingManager.beatsToTicks`.
    -   After snapping, also call `clock.setTick(snapped)` so internal fractional remainder cleared and no latent forward jump occurs later.
-   On loop wrap detection inside transport controller, reset `clock.setTick(loopStartTick)` before writing store to maintain consistency.

### 4.5 Handling BPM Change and Ranges

-   Decide semantics: Should loops & playback range be musical (beats/ticks) or absolute time?
    -   If MUSICAL (recommended): Leave ticks unchanged on BPM change (current design—document this).
    -   If user expectation is time-consistent, store loop definitions internally also as seconds and recompute ticks each BPM change. Clarify in UI tooltip.
-   Document chosen policy; adjust UI labeling (e.g., "Loop (musical bars)").

### 4.6 Performance / Drift

-   Replace approximate `approxSecondsPerBeat = tm.getSecondsPerBeat(tm.ticksToSeconds(this._tick))` with:
    -   For tempo maps: integrate segment-aware delta or smaller multi-step if dt spans multiple tempo changes (future improvement).
    -   For now acceptable; just ensure BPM changes reflect immediately because `getSecondsPerBeat` consults updated segments.

### 4.7 Additional Safeguards

-   Add guard in subscription shim: if authority not 'clock' and transport.isPlaying, prefer 'clock' to prevent old user scrub overriding live playback.
-   Provide debug devtool: a panel showing current authoritative tick, derived seconds, BPM, secondsPerBeat, last frame dt.

## 5. **UPDATED** Suggested Implementation Steps (Prioritized by Impact)

**PHASE 1 - CRITICAL (High Impact, Immediate Fixes):**

1. **Export shared TimingManager singleton** from timelineStore
2. **Replace all TimingManager instantiations** in VisualizerContext with shared reference
3. **Update setGlobalBpm** to call `sharedTimingManager.setBPM()` immediately
4. **Simplify VisualizerContext sync logic** - establish unidirectional flow (Clock→Store→Visualizer)

**PHASE 2 - IMPORTANT (Medium Impact):** 5. **Add clock alignment** to `play()` method after quantization 6. **Update tests** - migrate timelineStore.behavior.test.ts to use ticks as primary 7. **Deprecate setCurrentTimeSec** path with warnings

**PHASE 3 - POLISH (Low Impact, Future):**  
8. **Add transport controller** abstraction (optional refactor) 9. **Authority semantics cleanup** 10. **Enhanced documentation** and debug tooling

**Expected Results After Phase 1:**

-   ✅ BPM changes take effect immediately during playback
-   ✅ Reduced pause/resume timing jumps
-   ✅ Consistent timing across all components

**Expected Results After Phase 2:**

-   ✅ Quantization alignment issues resolved
-   ✅ Test suite validates actual tick behavior
-   ✅ Deprecated legacy APIs with clear migration path

## 6. Risk & Edge Cases

Edge Cases to handle:

-   Rapid BPM changes while playing: ensure no runaway fractional accumulation (reset fractional on BPM change).
-   Tempo map insertion mid-play: need to realign seconds query so `getSecondsPerBeat` matches new segment (call `clock.setTick(clock.currentTick)` optionally).
-   Loop region shorter than accumulated dt between frames: after wrap, ensure we don't double-advance (wrap first, then propagate).
-   Pausing immediately after play before first `update()` call: clock last time null—resuming should not skip.
-   Zero or negative dt (tab freeze): protect with current `dtMs <= 0` guard (already present).

## 9. **ASSESSMENT CONCLUSION**

**OVERALL VIABILITY**: ✅ **HIGHLY VIABLE** - The proposed solutions directly address the identified root causes

**KEY FINDINGS FROM CODE REVIEW**:

-   The assessment correctly identified multiple TimingManager instances as a core issue
-   The PlaybackClock pause handling was mischaracterized - the animation loop properly guards updates
-   The visualizer-clock synchronization logic is indeed overly complex and error-prone
-   Test migration strategy is sound and necessary

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL**: **HIGH** - Phase 1 fixes target the exact code paths causing user-reported issues:

-   BPM changes not taking effect → Multiple TimingManager instances not synced
-   Pause/resume jumps → Complex bi-directional sync races in VisualizerContext
-   Quantize misalignment → Clock not aligned after transport snapping

**RISK ASSESSMENT**: **LOW** - Proposed changes are:

-   Focused on specific, well-understood code sections
-   Maintain backward compatibility during transition
-   Add safeguards rather than removing functionality
-   Testable with existing test infrastructure

**RECOMMENDATION**: Proceed with implementation starting with Phase 1 fixes. The shared TimingManager approach will provide immediate relief for the most critical user-facing timing issues.

| Problem                                  | Root Cause(s) | Revised Solution(s)                                                              | Priority     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Tempo change ignored during playback** | B, G          | **Phase 1**: Single timing manager; propagate BPM to shared instance immediately | 🔴 CRITICAL  |
| **Playhead jump after pause**            | A, C          | **Phase 1**: Simplify sync logic; establish unidirectional authority flow        | 🔴 CRITICAL  |
| **Quantize causing unexpected movement** | D             | **Phase 2**: Align clock tick after quantization in play() method                | 🟡 IMPORTANT |
| **Tests masking tick-domain bugs**       | E             | **Phase 2**: Migrate test to use ticks as primary, seconds as derived            | 🟡 IMPORTANT |
| **General timing inconsistency**         | B, C, G       | **Phase 1**: Replace all ad-hoc TimingManager instances with shared singleton    | 🔴 CRITICAL  |

**Key Insight**: The most critical issues (tempo changes not taking effect, timing jumps) are primarily caused by **multiple unsynced TimingManager instances** rather than fundamental architectural flaws. The proposed Phase 1 fixes should resolve the core user-facing problems.
