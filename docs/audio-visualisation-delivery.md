# Audio visualisation delivery

_Last reviewed: 2025-05-18_

## Delivered phases

### Phase 0 – Foundations and alignment
- Catalogued legacy single-feature bindings for spectrum, meter, and oscilloscope elements and
  documented migration paths to multi-feature bindings.
- Refreshed shared glossary entries covering analysis profiles, feature descriptors, track references,
  and channel aliases so implementation, UX, and documentation use consistent language.
- Captured approved UX flows for cache regeneration prompts and diagnostics, establishing the baseline
  for later implementation phases.

### Phase 2 – Authoring UX and validation
- Shipped the hierarchical inspector selector with multi-select support across tracks, feature
  categories, descriptors, and channel aliases.
- Delivered inline validation that recommends analysis profiles as descriptor requirements change while
  logging selector usage for ongoing tuning.
- Verified deterministic scene persistence, undo/redo stability, and tooltip/help copy aligned with the
  shared glossary.

### Phase 3 – Cache intents and diagnostics
- Implemented structured `AnalysisIntent` emission per element, aggregated scheduler diffs, and
  deterministic regeneration queues.
- Released a non-blocking diagnostics banner and panel that group missing, stale, and extraneous
  descriptors by track/profile with targeted regeneration controls.
- Logged regeneration history for developer tooling and export manifests while bounding retention to
  keep project payloads lean.
