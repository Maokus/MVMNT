## Goals (for video / rendered visualizers)

When designing these for baked animation, your aim is not measurement precision but **readability, expressiveness, coherence, and control over “emotion”**. The visualizations should:

-   React responsively to audio without being noisy or jittery.
-   Maintain legibility (users watching video snapshots or transitions should see meaningful structure).
-   Support stylistic variation (e.g. calm, aggressive, pastel, neon).
-   Be exportable at arbitrary resolution / framerate.

Thus: expose enough control so creators tune feel; hide any interactive UI gimmicks.

## Module: Spectrum Display (FFT / spectral bars / curves)

### What it shows / behavior

-   A transform-based view of spectral magnitude vs frequency, rendered as a line, area, bars, or hybrid.
-   Smooth temporal transitions so motion is fluid.
-   Optional peak-history glow or trace accent to emphasize strong frequencies over time.
-   (Optional) spectral balancing or weighting (e.g. tilt bass/treble) for “stylistic boost.”

### Controls (parameters) to expose

Here’s a recommended set of parameters your user could tweak when authoring a visualization:

These controls give creators levers to “tune the feel” of the spectrum: how jittery it is, how aggressive the motion, how bright or glowing, how much low or high is emphasized.

## Module: Volume / Level Meter (Envelope / loudness bar)

In many visuals, a volume meter is simpler (not a precise measurement but a “level bar” or reactive meter).

### What it shows / behavior

-   A fill or bar (or other shape) whose height (or radius, width, etc.) responds to instantaneous or smoothed amplitude or RMS.
-   A “peak memory” or historic maximum stylized accent.
-   Transition smoothing to avoid jumpiness.

### Controls to expose

| Parameter                             | Type / Range                                | Description                                              | Suggested default                     |

| **Attack / release (rise/fall time)** | float (ms or normalized)                    | How fast the meter rises/falls to new value              | attack ~10–50 ms; release ~200–800 ms |
| **Smoothing / inertia**               | float blending factor                       | Additional smoothing over time                           | ~0.2                                  |

| **Scaling / mapping curve**           | linear → power / logarithmic mapping        | Map audio amplitude to display space with artistic curve | e.g. sqrt curve                       |
| **Min / max clamp**                   | min and max output bounds                   | Optionally clamp behavior to avoid overdrive             | depends on artistic choice            |
| **Color / gradient mapping**          | mapping from level to color / brightness    | e.g. green → yellow → red transitions                    | preset palettes + custom              |
| **Shape / orientation**               | enum {vertical, horizontal, radial, custom} | Flexibility if meter is not strictly a bar               | vertical default                      |
| **Opacity mapping**                   | optional curve (level → alpha)              | Lower levels may fade more to background                 | gentle fade                           |
| **Baseline / zero hold visuals**      | styling for when level is zero              | subtle idle glow, ambient pulse, etc.                    | minimal                               |
| **text label**                        | enum {off, top, bottom, track}              | text label that shows the current volume in db           | bottom                                |

Because this meter is in the context of a rendered visual, you might also let creators map meter value to _other visual effects_ (scale, glow, filter), but that’s beyond the core spec.

## Module: Oscilloscope (Waveform / trace visual)

This is the “moving waveform” visual: plotting time-domain sample values over a sliding window of time.

### What it shows / behavior

-   The instantaneous waveform of audio samples, optionally across left / right channels or merged.
-   Persistence or trace history (fading trails).
-   Stylized motion or “elasticity” — the trace shouldn’t vibrate like raw noise; smoothing or resampling often helps.

Additionally, borrowing from oscilloscope persistence design: you might provide two modes of persistence:

-   **Time-based persistence** (older traces fade over time)
-   **Frequency-based persistence** (intensity maps to how often a point is drawn) ([picotech.com][1])

These allow a kind of “heatmap” of where the waveform is most often passing.

## Rendering / Motion Considerations (for baked visuals)

Because this is a static render pipeline, you can do things differently (and more flexibly) than in a live UI:

-   Precompute FFT / waveform data at your project’s sample rate / frame rate, then animate frames.
-   Use _temporal blending_ (motion interpolation) to smooth transitions.
-   Use _oversampling / interpolation_ within a frame if your resolution is high.
-   Use _offscreen buffers_ or _accumulation textures_ to build persistence / trail effects with controlled decay.
-   Support _frame rate independence_ — controls should be independent of playback FPS.
-   Optimize: only redraw geometry changes; reuse vertex buffers when spectrum / waveform bins count is stable.

## Cross-module / Global Controls (for the visual workspace)

Because your app is about creating visuals, the user should have a master set of controls to coordinate style across modules:

-   **Global timing / smoothing multiplier**: scale of how fast or slow all visual animations progress (e.g. slower trails for dreamy looks, faster for punch).
-   **Global color scheme / palette mapping**: define shared palettes or gradients that all modules can reference (so spectrum, meter, oscilloscope can share aesthetic cohesiveness).
-   **Master gain / normalization**: allow the visualizer to be “driven” by scaled audio input (so quiet tracks get boosted, loud stay within bounds).
-   **Master glow / bloom / post effect**: a post-render glow/blur pass, color bloom, vignette, etc.
-   **Background / canvas styling**: background color, noise texture, subtle gradient or ambient animation behind the meters.
-   **Motion / easing curves**: a global easing or interpolation curve (linear, ease-in/out, smoothstep) used in modules to animate their parameter transitions.
-   **Export settings**: target resolution, frame rate, duration, overshoot margins (to avoid clipping), dithering or motion blur across frames.
-   **Preset / template library**: allow users to save a set of module parameter configurations, color themes, and layout, so they can reuse them in future projects.
-   **Relative parameter linking**: e.g. link the meter’s release time to spectrum smoothing; or link glow intensity to overall volume.

One important thing: **don’t burden the user with low-level real-time UI controls** like click-to-clear peak holds, axis zoom dragging, etc. All control should be via parameter panels or timeline automation, not interactive meter UI. The user edits parameters once, then the system renders.

## Revised Module Summary (for video visualizers)

-   **Spectrum**: core module to show frequency distribution. Emphasize smooth motion, glow trails, and expressive mapping controls.
-   **Meter / Level Bar**: simpler, strong reactive shape. Good as accent visuals, or mapped to scale/size of other visuals.
-   **Oscilloscope / Waveform Trace**: organic motion, waveform shape, persistence trails, with optional channel modes and traces.
-   **Optional hybrids or extras**: e.g. spectrogram heatmap (time vs frequency), stereo-phase Lissajous (XY plots) — these follow similar control patterns (window length, persistence, color mapping, interpolation).

If you like, I can turn this into a JSON schema for module parameters or a UI panel mockup (which controls to group, defaults, dependencies). Would you like me to do that next?
