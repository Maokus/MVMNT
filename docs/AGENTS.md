# Documentation Guidelines

-   Keep documentation evergreen: update examples, command names, and review dates when material changes.
-   Avoid references to internal roadmaps, phased rollouts, or tentative timelines. Focus on current behavior and actionable guidance.
-   Status files or plans should go into /thoughts rather than /docs
-   Prefer descriptive headings (`## Section`) and bulleted lists for procedures; keep line lengths under ~100 characters for easier diffs.
-   When referencing commands, wrap them in fenced code blocks.
-   adhere to descriptive-lowercase-kebab-file-name.md naming convention
