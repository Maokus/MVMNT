Issue: No mention of AudioContext.sampleRate differences between live decode and offline mix (you fix offline to 48 kHz). Mismatched rates cause offset drift if you compute positions only in seconds/ticks.

Fix: Normalize all time math to samples at each context’s sample rate when scheduling. For export, resample (if needed) into 48 kHz with precise sample offsets derived from ticks.

Issue: regionStartTick / regionEndTick are optional but not normalized. Missing normalization leads to negative lengths or out-of-range offsets.

Fix: On ingest and each edit, clamp region to [0, durationTicks], enforce start ≤ end, and store a canonical “render region.”

Issue: Expecting identical PCM bytes across browsers can fail: WebAudio implementations can differ slightly (denormals, dither, resampling kernels). Your DoD states byte-for-byte equality. That’s risky.

Fix: Define determinism as sample-accurate timing and amplitude within a tiny epsilon, or limit “identical bytes” to same engine + version (which you partly encode in the hash). Document this explicitly.

Issue: WebCodecs/H.264 availability varies; timestamp rounding and encoder VFR behavior can introduce A/V skew if you map ticksPerFrame to frame PTS with floats.

Fix: Convert ticks→integer timebase (e.g., timescale 1e6 or 90 kHz), accumulate integer PTS, and only then render the frame at that exact PTS. Keep audio and video in the same integer timebase before muxing.
