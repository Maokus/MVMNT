# Documentation Guidelines

- Keep documentation evergreen: update examples, command names, and review dates when material changes.
- Avoid references to internal roadmaps, phased rollouts, or tentative timelines. Focus on current behavior and actionable guidance.
- Prefer descriptive headings (`## Section`) and bulleted lists for procedures; keep line lengths under ~100 characters for easier diffs.
- When referencing commands, wrap them in fenced code blocks.
