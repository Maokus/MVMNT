ðŸŽ¨ UI Description: Adobe After Effects Properties Panel (Compact & Readable)
General Layout

    Vertical stack layout with collapsible property groups (e.g. Transform, Effects).

    Minimal padding between groups and rows to conserve space.

    Each group is represented as a collapsible/expandable section, often with a small triangle or chevron icon to the left to toggle visibility.

    Flat, semi-dark background with clear contrast between text and background.

Typography

    Sans-serif font, compact and readable (similar to Adobe Clean or Roboto).

    Font size: ~11â€“12px.

    Left-aligned labels, with consistent indentation.

    Bold for group headers; regular weight for individual properties.

Property Rows

Each row typically contains:

    Label (e.g., "Position", "Opacity").

    Numerical input fields (X/Y coordinates, percentages, etc.).

    Linked fields often appear side-by-side (e.g., X and Y).

    A reset icon or stopwatch icon for keyframing (used to toggle animation on/off).

Spacing

    Minimal vertical spacing (~4â€“6px) between rows.

    Very tight horizontal alignment between label and field.

    Padding within input fields is small; fields are compact but clickable.

    Indentation is used to show hierarchy (e.g. "Transform" group â†’ "Position").

Controls and Interactions

    Toggle buttons, small sliders, checkboxes, or dropdowns depending on property type.

    Input fields are clickable and editable, often supporting click+drag value scrubbing.

    Animation icon (stopwatch) is a key interaction affordance.

    Hover effects: Slight highlight or border to show interactivity.

    Right-click context menus on many items for advanced options.

Color Scheme

    Dark UI theme:

        Background: #2C2C2C to #383838.

        Text: Light gray to white (#E0E0E0).

        Input fields: Slightly lighter background with subtle border or no border.

        Active elements (sliders, icons): Blue or light highlight.

Icons

    Simple, monochrome, flat SVG-style icons.

    Icons include:

        Stopwatch (for animation toggle).

        Reset (revert value).

        Toggle visibility or collapse.

    Icons are 14â€“16px max, with subtle hover states.

Responsiveness

    Properties panel scales vertically with the window.

    Auto-adjusts to available width; wraps or ellipsizes long text labels.

    Mouse scroll to navigate vertically, optionally collapsible sections to declutter.

Group Structure Example

â–¼ Transform
   â–¸ Anchor Point     [ X: 960.0 ] [ Y: 540.0 ]
   â–¸ Position         [ X: 960.0 ] [ Y: 540.0 ]
   â–¸ Scale            [ 100.0% ]
   â–¸ Rotation         [ 0.0Â° ]
   â–¸ Opacity          [ 100% ]

Interaction Hints

    Clicking label or value selects field.

    Double-click allows full text selection.

    Dragging on value fields increments/decrements numerically.

    Shift/Ctrl modifiers allow precise or accelerated input.
