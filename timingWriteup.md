Here’s a focused writeup based on the src layout of timing_system_overhaul and common transport/playback patterns used in web audio + MIDI apps. I’ll explain how the system is likely structured, how transport and playback flow end-to-end, and where bugs like “can’t start playback after a MIDI track upload” tend to come from in this architecture.

What the src layout implies about responsibilities
- core: The audio engine, transport/clock, scheduler, timeline math, and any audio/MIDI routing primitives typically live here. Expect the transport controller and scheduler loop here.
- state: Global app state (e.g., Zustand/Redux) that holds transport flags (playing/paused/stopped), the current position, tempo, PPQ/timebase, loop region, loaded tracks/clips, and engine readiness flags.
- hooks: React hooks bridging UI/state to engine (e.g., useTransport, useScheduler, useAudioContext). These often own lifecycle and subscriptions that start/stop scheduling.
- bindings: File/device bindings (MIDI importer, possibly Web MIDI input). The MIDI upload/import code likely lives here and creates tracks/clips/events, tempo/time signature map, PPQ, and project length updates.
- context: React contexts to pass engine/transport/project handles through the tree.
- utils and math: Time conversions between bars/beats/ticks/seconds, tempo map utilities, quantization, position formatting.
- animation: Timeline playback cursor, scrolling, and visual sync (requestAnimationFrame).
- ui/pages: Transport controls (Play/Pause/Stop/Loop), track lanes, and arrangement views that drive transport actions.

How transport and playback typically flow in this setup
- Initialization
  - An audio engine in core initializes an AudioContext (suspended by default on many browsers) and constructs a scheduler with a lookahead window (e.g., 50–200 ms) and an internal “current tick/time” cursor.
  - State layer exposes flags like engineReady, transportState (stopped/playing/paused), currentPosition, bpm, ppq, loop.
- Starting playback (Play)
  - UI (ui/ or pages/) dispatches an action or calls a hook to:
    1) Ensure AudioContext is running (resume on user gesture).
    2) Mark state as “playing” (or transition state machine to Playing).
    3) Start the scheduler loop: set base audio time and base tick, then, on an interval, schedule notes/events ahead from all active tracks.
  - Visuals in animation subscribe to transport position and update the playhead with requestAnimationFrame; some implementations compute position from the audio clock via baseTime + elapsed rather than relying on state ticks to reduce jitter.
- Scheduling loop
  - The scheduler iterates events per track for the [now, now+lookahead] window, converts event ticks -> audio times using tempo map and PPQ, then queues notes/clips into the synth/graph.
  - The loop advances a “last scheduled tick” marker so events are scheduled exactly once.
- Pausing/Stopping
  - Pausing freezes the transport position; stopping resets position to 0 (or loop start) and may clear scheduled-but-not-yet-played buffers.
- MIDI upload integration
  - bindings parses the MIDI file into:
    - A tempo/time signature map (global or track-local).
    - PPQ (ticks per quarter), sometimes per-file.
    - Note events with tick start/duration, track assignments.
  - state inserts tracks/clips/events, updates project length, possibly updates BPM/timebase, and sets flags like projectReady or tracksLoaded.
  - core may need to rebuild its tempo map, reset conversion caches, and sometimes reinitialize the scheduler cursor.

Why playback can fail after MIDI upload: high-probability culprits
- AudioContext not resumed after an upload-triggered state change
  - On many browsers (especially Safari/iOS), the AudioContext starts in “suspended” and must be resumed in a direct user gesture (click/tap).
  - If the upload flow causes the app to lose the context state (recreate/detach nodes) or if Play is gated behind async parsing (no immediate user gesture), resume() may never be called successfully before scheduling. Result: transport appears to start, but nothing sounds.
  - Symptom: pressing Play does nothing or sets “playing” state without audio; context.state remains 'suspended'.
- Race condition between parsing and transport readiness
  - If Play is pressed while the MIDI importer is still parsing, indexes are building, or state hasn’t set projectReady, the UI might block playback (“no tracks/clips yet”) or the scheduler thinks there’s nothing to schedule and never flips to an active loop.
  - If the importer resets transportState to stopped and never sets ready flags after finishing, Play remains disabled or no-op.
- PPQ/timebase mismatch leading to invalid times
  - If the engine assumes a global PPQ (e.g., 480) but the imported file has a different PPQ, conversions from ticks to seconds can produce NaN, negative, or huge numbers.
  - Schedulers commonly skip events with invalid or out-of-window times, so nothing schedules.
  - Also happens if tempo map conversion doesn’t handle deltaTime vs absolute time correctly.
- Tempo/tempo map rebuild not propagated to the scheduler
  - After import, if the tempo map is updated but the scheduler keeps a stale reference or cached closures, it will compute wrong schedule times and may drop events as “in the past” or “not yet ready.”
- Stale closures in hooks after import re-renders
  - React hooks like useEffect/useCallback can capture stale engine/scheduler references. If a new engine object is created during import (e.g., reinitialization), Play may call start() on an old, detached instance.
  - Symptom: state changes to playing, but the real scheduler loop never starts.
- Store updates not triggering due to mutation
  - If state is mutated in-place during import (e.g., pushing to arrays without creating new references), selectors/hooks might not re-run and the scheduler doesn’t see new tracks or a ready flag.
- Start/stop reentrancy and idempotency bugs
  - Pressing Play quickly around import, or Play/Stop during parsing, can leave the transport state machine in an impossible state (e.g., both “stopped” and “playing”, or a pending promise rejects and flips state back).
  - If start() isn’t idempotent, multiple scheduler loops can get created and then torn down inconsistently, often leaving none active.
- Instrument/graph not connected or not loaded post-import
  - If tracks are created without a default instrument/sampler or destinations aren’t wired, events get scheduled but there’s no audible output.
  - Common when the importer creates tracks but the synth layer loads asynchronously; Play fires before sample/patch load resolves.
- Loop/position boundary issues after project length changes
  - Import might set the project length shorter than the current position, causing scheduling to think it’s at/after end-of-song and skip everything.
  - If loop is enabled and loopStart/loopEnd are invalid (loopEnd <= loopStart), some implementations avoid starting entirely.
- Animation-driven feedback masking engine inactivity
  - If the UI playhead is advanced by requestAnimationFrame using a computed velocity instead of the engine’s scheduler timebase, the UI can “move” while audio never starts, hiding the real failure.
- Workers/AudioWorklets lifecycle during import
  - If a Worker or AudioWorkletNode is torn down during import (e.g., to rebuild tempo map) and not restarted/reconnected, the scheduler posts messages to a dead port.

Other systemic issues to watch for
- Event de-duplication markers not reset on import (e.g., lastScheduledTick greater than new first event tick).
- Gating conditions too strict (e.g., require at least one “armed” track to start, or require a metronome track but it’s disabled).
- Error handling that swallows rejections from resume() or from scheduling futures, quietly leaving transport “playing” but doing nothing.
- Multiple competing clocks (requestAnimationFrame vs setInterval vs audioContext.currentTime) without a single source of truth; drift or start-phase bugs are common.

Concrete places (by folder) where these behaviors typically live
- core: Transport controller (start/stop/pause), scheduler loop, tempo map converters, audio graph setup.
- state: transport flags, position, BPM/PPQ, loaded tracks; selectors used by hooks/UI to decide if Play is enabled.
- hooks: useTransport/useScheduler/useAudioContext; look for dependencies arrays and closures that can go stale after import.
- bindings: MIDI importer; post-parse actions that update PPQ/tempo map, tracks, and transport readiness.
- utils/math: tick/beat/second conversions; validate outputs for NaN/Infinity/negative times after import.
- animation: timeline cursor; ensure it subscribes to the engine clock or a derived, authoritative transport time.

Targeted checks and quick diagnostics
- Verify AudioContext state on Play: if suspended, call and await audioContext.resume() in the user-gesture handler; log failures.
- Guard start() with idempotency and an engineReady flag. Log every transport state transition and why it happens.
- After import, validate:
  - PPQ used by the engine equals the imported PPQ or conversions normalize one to the other.
  - Tempo map is replaced atomically and the scheduler picks up the new reference before starting.
  - Position is reset to a valid in-range value or loopStart if looping.
- In the scheduler, assert that every computed schedule time is finite and non-negative. Log and count drops.
- In hooks, review useEffect/useCallback dependencies for engine/transport objects; avoid stale closures by referencing stable controllers or using refs.
- Ensure tracks have an audible destination/instrument before enabling Play; if instruments load asynchronously, gate Play on instrumentsReady.

Common remediation patterns
- Centralize a finite-state machine for transport (e.g., explicit states: Idle -> Ready -> Playing -> Paused -> Stopped) with clearly defined transitions and guards (engineReady, projectReady, instrumentsReady).
- Canonicalize timebase: pick one PPQ and convert imported events; never mix heterogeneous PPQs post-import.
- Make start/stop idempotent and reentrant-safe; a single scheduler loop guarded by a token or running flag.
- Atomically swap tempo map and reset lastScheduledTick on import.
- Tie UI playhead to the audio clock (derived from baseTime + currentTime) rather than an animation-only clock.

Given the current directory structure, the most likely root causes for “can’t start playback after a MIDI track is uploaded” are:
- AudioContext not resumed in a valid gesture path post-import.
- Tempo/PPQ conversion mismatch producing invalid schedule times.
- Scheduler not restarted or stuck with stale references after the importer updates state.
- Transport gating conditions not satisfied because ready flags aren’t set or position/loop boundaries are invalid.
- Instruments not ready/connected immediately after tracks are created by the importer.

If you want, I can drill into specific files under core, state, hooks, and bindings to map these observations to exact code paths and suggest precise fixes.
